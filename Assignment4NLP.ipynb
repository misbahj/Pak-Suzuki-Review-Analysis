However, the back is a little bit odd, but the tail lights should be on the trunk. Overall, I liked its exterior. In the interior, the dashboard is very beautiful especially dual tone. It has practical and safety features such as power windows, retractable-adjustable side mirrors, LCD, dual airbags, and ABS brakes. Let's move on to the engine specs, it has an R-series 660cc engine which is capable of producing  39 hp and 56 nm torque. While driving, this car has optimal power. Never felt underpowered with 4 to 5 passengers. It has decent pick and engine response.  As we talk we talk about its comfort, it is outclass especially the front seats. The back seat comfort can be improved by adding 2 headrests to it, but the cushioning is very soft so I will add a plus point to it. The ride quality is very smooth and the handling is also. My final verdict is that you have to purchase this  car even it cost 3 million                     More                                    Less\\nStyle: 4\\nComfort: 4\\nFuel_Economy: 5\\nPerformance: 5\\nValue_for_Money: 1\\nYear: 2023\", metadata={'source': 'suzuki review', 'row': 14}),\n",

Not for everyone, but if tall cars tickle your fancy, it's a winner.Interior: For tall folks, the headspace is a dream. But, if you've got long legs, it's a tad tight. And pack light—the trunk isn’t roomy.Fuel Economy: Started with an okay 8 MPG in the city. Post-tune-up, it’s 10-12 MPG around town and a cool 16-18 MPG on highways—with the AC on full blast.Ride & Handling: Compared to my '06 Coure, it's comfier and handles nicely.Verdict: It's a car with quirks and character.

It needs to be checked.Car's front Windscreen is bubbly from the bottom which gives a distorted vision.Car has an extremely beautiful interior but the company has used hard quality plastic all around.

It looks good only when it is in other hands. Reality comes after you buy. I bought Suzuki Swift for & I received it on 6th Jan. Since day 1 its AC was not working. I submitted the complaint to dealership and Suzuki Customer Service Center. Dealership called the vehicle for inspection and upon inspection they told me that its AC condenser is damaged. I asked them to cover this in warranty as at that time vehicle was brand new and used for few hundreds KMs only. Initially Pak Suzuki Denied for Warranty Claim but later Dealership told me that  Pak Suzuki has approved request to cover damages for broken part under warranty and they will provide me Replacement part once available. But later on 31st March Dealership called me and told me that I will not get replacement part as Pak Suzuki has again denied the request for Warranty Claim. Better not to buy any car from Suzuki Swift. Suzuki is a group of thugs and fraudsters.

Used it for every purpose, for long routes and city. Car is good in Fuel Economy, whereas the issues with Built Quality are more, ride Quality is Inferior compared to other cars. Handling is OK, while leg space is also good. But Overall some basic features like Adjustable Steering and Rear Headrest could be given, which I really feel missing in my Car. The car's AGS gearbox is a bit Jerky which could be made better. After 50k, the Lack and Shifts are delayed very much.  Overall I've kept it for better fuel efficiency and maneuverability. Its not recommended to take this car on long routes, as car although is reliable but is way too Underpowered for highway Travelling.

The car is unbelievably comfortable and offers almost the same features as a brand new honda city. In 2017, I had the option to buy a city or a corolla but I went with the newly launched Ciaz. Now in 2022, I booked a City 2022 CVT but after the drive, I was truly disappointed and decided to keep my Ciaz for the new few years. The vehicle lacks some basic features such as alloy rims, steering controls, LCD with back Cam, and fog lights but these things are easily available in the market at a very cheap price. Talking about the fuel average, it easily give me 14kmpl in city and 17-18 kmpl on long routes which is one of the best in it's class. Even today it's a very good car to be considered and these vehicles are available in the market with cheap prices and low mileage. Parts availability isn't an issue but yes they are a bit expensive as compared to corolla and city.

Driving position and comfort was a plus too, though noisy cabin (mainly engine noise though you get used to it, if its your daily driver) and manual windows were a let down and the biggest was non abs brakes. Sold it after10 months and booked picanto manual , what a car it is excellent.It used to  give me 14 kmpl on same route with AC. Booked Swift GL, Better than picanto in space, emgine is very smooth, it doesnot vibrate like picanto on 1.5 rpm in 3rd and 4th gear. the car has Vehicle stability. Gear shift and clutch are light like picanto. It is returning 17 kmpl (Will get better when car clocks 5000 kms on odo) on same route on which alto and picanto recorded 20 to 21 and 14 to 15 respectively.

Its interior and exterior remained original, suspension needed to be re-coated though other than that, it accumulated rust on the lower edges of  the wheel arches of the vehicle rear. I think that as far as fuel average is concerned, it was 18 but this benefit got reduced when air or oil filter had to be changed. Their cost is triple than similar parts that are used for P.K.D.M. vehicles Moreover, without Hi-Octane being filled twice a month, it's engine used to knock. Mechanics charge high rate for repairing a sophisticated car and only select mechanics can deal with problems arising in. Ours needed A.C. and steering repair and it cost us 60,000.Therefore, as far as cost saving is concerned, P.K.D.M. vehicles are much better, they can deal with mineral oil. This Alto on the other hand can do well with synthetic oil only.

Alsvin  has already captured market with sedan shape and numerous features and superb quality. New swift would have been launched with Hybrid engine to become exclusive in technology and would have attracted the customer even with more price but brand new hybrid car manufactured in Pakistan.  Customers have realized that they are using Chinese spare parts in Japanese cars so its better to buy Chinese car instead of locally assembled Japanese low quality cars with very expensive spare parts.

We want to buy a small hatchback car for family. We searched for Cultus, Santro, Cours & Alto and at last bought alto. Now we all are happy with this car. This is a good car. There are only two minus points of this car 1st. is Bad fuel average and 2nd. is expensive spare parts. That's main negative points of this car, because in this budget of 4-6 lacks most people have to buy a car with good fuel avg and low price parts and this car has these negative points, and mehran have very very good  fuel average and spare parts are????... But if you can afford its expense then its a very good car especially it's AC Is very chilled, interior is made up of good plastic, and it's a simple car. Megran don't have AC, Alto have AC, mehran is 800cc, alto is 1000cc, Engine performance is also good if the car os maintained well.. It is a good budget car but only fuel average is the minus point!!! It's a beautiful,stylish car also.

But I trust Allah and purchased this car and now I'm so happy. I personally inspect my car from every single inch and I won't be able to find a single company's fault. The Exterior is Good as well as Interior and the engine performance is average bcz its a city car and you can't expect a higher engine performance. The average it's giving me 13 to 14 km/l but it depends on person to person on how you drive but overall its value for money. If you are going for picanto the 3 main issues on that car are 1. Delivery takes too much time after booking process. 2. The average is not good as compare to Cultus. 3. High prices of Parts and availability issues. I inspect every single car but i found this one value for Money and even after booking company delivers my car in just 1 month isn't that amazing. I hope my Review help you.

Anyways, the car serves purpose that is offer a chance to travel from point A to point B within low cost over a ride that one can call their own and can house family members. I have put it through 65,000 of broken kilometers  of roads between Hyderabad and Sukhur and so far it has proved words of Ali Khan about Mehran a lie. Over this period I have spent only PKR 4,500  over suspension and engine seals as well as foundation. I suspect a feat that neither Cherry QQ or any other Chinese box could achieve. I would buy a newer Mehran any day, because I know I don't want to look good but go for product that offers utility and Mehran does that.

The exterior is sporty and good looking and I liked the interior too. The build quality is just average and the new infotainment screen looks pretty stylish. The leg room can be a problem in the back seats but I think that's manageable. While driving the suspension is average and can feel stiff at times. The thing I love about this car is it's performance. The 1.3 litre DOHC engine doesn't let down in providing a fun drive especially if you get the manual transmission one. The car accelerates quickly when floored. However, the fuel average is on the lower side, I usually got 9-10. Highly recommend for an enthusiast who wants maximum power while driving. But as a daily family car, I don't think it's the best option. I personally love this car.

The new WagonR VXL comes with alloy rims and new infotainment system. I preferred it over Cultus and Picanto. The wagonR is more practical for urban traveling with traffic jams and uneven roads and speed breakers. Hopefully this new WagonR will insha'Allah be performing well. If Suzuki could give ABS in WagonR then it would be better. About resale value: the WagonR MashaAllah sells like a hot cake. Matain your car through 3S dealers. It gives 14km/liter with AC in city with light foot and gear shitfting at 2.5k RPM. On motorways it can give upto 18+km/liter with high.octane mixed with petrol in 2:5 or 1:4 ratio. Suzuki sells the spare parts (air & oil filters) at gold rates so get the Guard Air filter, Mehran oil filter and genuine oil (Suzuki oil) to be ecnomical. Use the General Tycoon tyres. The car is overall spacious and reliable. Cultus and Picanto are overly priced and have almost same space and features.

The interior is relatively better with ample leg room for it's size. Steering wheel height cannot be adjusted. Trunk space is next to nothing and there's no spare tyre. Seats are kind of hard and not good for long distance travelling. Driving at or over 100 kmph speed causes it to start vibrating uncontrollably and handling is mediocre at best. It doesn't even have rear speakers. Only commendable part is that it has an excellent fuel average. It's definitely a car better suited to within city travel and taking it out on the motorways might just be a death wish. Finally, the price tag associated with the car is definitely not worth the trouble and hopefully, increasing competition in the local car market might help tone it down a notch since nothing about the car says its worth 17 lakh rupees.

I have taken this car to Naran, Murree, Azad Kashmir (Neelum Valley) many times with 5 persons and luggage on board. This car provided excellent performance on hilly areas with full 5 persons on board along with luggage. Last month I travelled to Karachi by road with 4 persons in car and with continuos driving on motoray we reached karachi in 15 hours. That was also excellent experience. Despite of completing 82000 KM in odo, its performance was extra ordinary and it was going on 130km/hr easily on motorway but little struggling to reach 140km/hr speed.The features I am missing in this car is power windows, power steering, ABS breaks and central locking.  Till now now I have changed rear suspensions of the car and all is genuine.i would recommend this car for small family. good and city and highway driving.

I  owned a 2011 model which was the second facelift and the car didn't disappoint in the looks department.The Interior of the car wasn't the best (material quality wise)  having hard plastic used throughout including the dashboard, door cards , console  and  everywhere possible. Engine wise the car was strong and had factory installed CNG which worked absolutely fine. The car used to run AC even on CNG and surprisingly worked awesome! What wasn't awesome was its fuel economy on Petrol. The engine of Alto VXR is known to have derived from Suzuki Potohar  therefore, has great pickup and torque though returns poor fuel economy. Belonging from a budget  category, the  car merely returned 10-12 km/l  with AC and a little over without. Long travels didn't make a significant difference either. The Ride Quality was great though thanks to Yokohama original low  profile tyres, the car glided and had great road grip.

When I bought this car in Feb 2019(zero meter) it feels very solid. But as the time passes(about a couple of month) the various parts of the car start making noises. Firstly the hood of the car was not properly fit and it starts making noise, then when I drove my car to about 5,000 km the rear driver's wheel starts making noise and now I have drove my car to about 25,000km and I am facing the exactly same problem, the dealership also don't know how to solve this problem. Also glove box is not properly fit.One of the passenger door also has noise issue. I am not satisfied with the built quality of this car.plus point: Perfomance is quite good. Engine runs smoothly.

The automatic gear system performs poorly in hilly conditions, so manual shift is recommended. The engine sound in the lower gears is very irritating, and sounds like a muffled two stroke motorcycle, but this sound disappears when you reach cruising speed. I enjoy driving it in manual mode. Vroom vroom.  But Don't expect it to perform like a normal automatic car. Pickup is good. Steering is smooth as butter. The car has an immobilizer against theft. It has no spare wheel, and has a puncture repair kit and a compressor. I cannot comment on the practibility of this system until I get a puncture.

Unless like the last 12 months  rates of used cars have gone up due Pakistan rupee value going down against the dollar as new car prices have increased  some 4 times in the last 12 months.I buy my car for 18.5 lac and l have been offered 22 lac, but l have no intention of selling.

And I have driven 8000 plus kms and I travelled on both sides (northern & Punjab side) fuel economy was unmatched with other cars. Comfort & space is brilliant and drive of the car is excellent. Only one issue I have faced is in manual transmission when you are on the first gear the pick of the car is excellent but in ags it doesn't give that much pick in 1st and 2nd but when you move forward it's totally superb. I recently went on the punjab tour my cousin had swift we both had a race on motorway initially swift had a gap because it has higher power after that cultus was ahead swift wasn't able to catch.

In interior, airbags are the only thing that lags and they should have been incorporatedby now. Navigation system is really good. Electrix sidemirrors and all four electric powerwindows are a great feature but only the driver s side window is autpmatically controlled with a single push and that too just for lowering the window. Coming to the exterior, i think its still the same since 2010 apart from nose grill, allpy wheels and fog lights. The road grip is amazing. The ride is a bit bumpy at sometimes when compared with other vehicles of same category. The only comparison for swift in the current Pakistani market is Toyota vitz. But as per my evaluation swift surpasses vitz in other departments apart from airbags. The main advantage over vitz is availability of spares and availability of the zero meter car.

With strong body, after ten years of rough use at time of sale it displayed very low corrosion.Though interior is plastic however, the quality is so good that it did not even bore scratch marks despite lack of polish.I would also like to add that apart from being comfortable, the Baleno gives excellent run; 15 kms with light foot in city use while over 17 kms on highway use are the figures that we got from this car. We traveled across Sind (from Karachi to Mirpurkhas more that 30 times) and back in days when M-9 was in pathetic conditions too however, despite that the car only cost us bushings and one damper over ten year use. I miss it, we only sold it because we thought that at 125,000 kms it may expose us to some unforeseen technical expense and we did not know a good mechanic.

Exterior look of car  is very decent and if kept neat and clean it looks very attractive. Actually it is very much better than its successor Liana. Build quality of car is very much impressive that after 16 years there is no corrosion or other body issues. 1300 cc efi engine of car has nice pick and travelled to hilly areas without any heat up or under power issues. Ac performance is very awesome even in very hot days. Fuel average is also a plus point giving 12.5km/l with ac in city and 14 on long with ac. I kept car with care so its interior is also fantastic. It is made up of plastic but has a very decent  look build quality of is not an issue. Seats are very comfortable. Boot space is very much can have alot luggage as i have removed cng cylinder. Ground clearance is optimum with cng cylinder and very good without it. Suspension of car is rigid. I have installed 15 inch alloy rims with low profile tires.Good resale.

It grows over you with time only if it makes up for it in a good way and after a month of driving that car, began to love it more with each passing day. Throttle response and faster gear changes, low end torque and supple suspension which soaks well the potholes in karachi and kept the car fairly flat through corners.

In Karachi as the major part of the year is summer, I have seen issues with the AGS in hot days in Karachi's traffic. I have observed that in summer when I am stuck in the traffic the warning light starts blinking and gives you the warning. That mostly happen when you have AC on even if its on lowest. The only way to get rid of the warning light is to park your car for 15 mins and let it cool which sometimes is annoying as how come you can park your car when you are in traffic. I asked Suzuki motor about this and the mentioned this is the issue with the AGS. It gets warmed up in the traffic and needs to be cooled. My question is they know they are launching this car in Pakistan, then how come they launch a system which is not reliable for Karachi Roads.Umair Ali                    More                                    Less\\nStyle: 4\\nComfort: 3\\nFuel_Economy: 3\\nPerformance: 3\\nValue_for_Money: 1\\nYear: 2019\", metadata={'source': 'suzuki review', 'row': 399}),\n",

Its bigger than Wagonr by few millimetres. Suspension is one of the things I liked most. I drove it with 4 adults and 2 children, reached to 120km before university gate reached, neans before 2km distance it reached that mark. With AC on, trip meter shiwed Avg to be at 16.8km/L,but mixed driving style. I should not say it's underpowered as I know I bought 658cc car, so it surpassed my expectations. AC performance is 3.8/5. Much better than the stupid Mehran. While I was driving, drivers of cars coming from opposite side noticed my car and seemed to say 'ACHA, YE HAY WO NEW ALTO, ACHI LAG RAHI HAY'.

The pick of the car is solid specially given the 1300cc engine it carries and it is swift in the true sense of the word. The compact design paired with a powerful engine reminds me of what the VW Beetle gives to the western market. Manuvering through heavy traffic on high speeds and easy parking is what it offers. 'Ghareebo ki beetle' or 'Ghareebo ki Mini Cooper'. That performance although comes at a cost. Averaging between 9.5 and 10.5 kml in city driving it is not the easiest on the average pocket. Interior wise it is just a disappointment, atleast in the long run. An 8 year old car's cabin just rattles at every bump. From the rearview mirror to the dashboard to the doors.

Fuel economy is the best thing i like about this car. From its build quality, it will not disappoint you. The car feels very solid and premium. One thing that is a turn off are the side mirrors, a person like me who is prone to use side mirrors, makes it very difficult to use them as we have to adjust them again and again.

If you buy the shape with eagle eye headlights it looks more unique with light blue reflection in the headlights and also more graceful tail lights. Overall the body is perfect for those who want their car to be small so its easier to drive but also want spaced interior. Interior is simple, nothing much graceful but its perfect for you if you don`t care about stylish features rather just some space to place your things. Talking about the power, cultus is powered enough if you run it without AC and just looking for a normal throttle not much racing. With AC it feels under powered but you can easily adjust if you keep  it at smaller gear and give more throttle. If you drive it decent, the car gives amazing average. Talking about something people don`t know, if you buy the car in white colour it gets tough to buy front and back doors. Also, they are more expensive.

Build is good, so is the ground clearance. Performance being an utmost important concern, this crossover is in a way better than its competitor Honda Vezel and in some comparisons it lags too. Like the suspension I must quote is way better than that of Vezel but the acceleration wise Vezel takes the lead and that however is because of that car being a hybrid equipped. Fuel economy is as good as a sedan and at times better, even. Depends how hard you're on the pedal. Also the driving modes will impact the collective fuel economy. Sports will give you an ultimate driving performance and pleasure but at the cost of burning more gas than Normal Auto mode. Interior I'd say gives a rugged look, not kind of a modern style. It's a bit of timeless design philosophy that some designs won't get obsolete. Like analogue clock and climate dials                    More                                    Less\\nStyle: 5\\nComfort: 4\\nFuel_Economy: 4\\nPerformance: 4\\nValue_for_Money: 5\\nYear: 2019\", metadata={'source': 'suzuki review', 'row': 430}),\n",

In terms of looks. The car can handle just fine. Like most cars do. The cars exterior is build well but minor accidents causes expensive repairs & replacements. The paint faints every day. The interior is not that comfortable. The seat comes with average covers. The dash board is simple.The interior built quality is very low. The car needs maintenance every 2 weeks. The wheel balance does not maintain well. The spare parts are very expensive.  The fuel average is very bad. A small trip inside a city can finish 13 liters easily. The cars ground clearance is average. the body hits every speed bump. As a whole the cars lacks many things and has many drawbacks but its still a good ride and does its job.

My brother has a new 2017 Suzuki Cultus Manual that gives only 11 km/l, which is pathetic for that car. Even an Altis Auto can give you that much mileage.  However, my Mehran VXR car gives an amazing average of 17 km/l, which is fantastic given the expectations of a fuel hike in the near future.I drive 58 km daily and there has not been a single heating issue. The drive is relatively quick and handles smoothly. The car's break response is also excellent that has saved me from at least one major accident. If you are a fuel-conscious person, and think that a car's only purpose is to get you from point A to B, and that spending on a luxury car is a waste of money, then believe me this is the best car you can find in the market.

Comfort is highly in negative. Space is just ok for a 5 member family.Fuel Economy:  Euro 2 better, than all the past models.

It's very compact and sporty just what one needs in today's crazy traffic. The interior is also clean and  modern especially the ODO looks good. I bought this car used from the first owner and was a bit apprehensive about  the quality , after having owned a cultus before. BUT the moment i drove it i fell in love with it. The drive never disappoints be it a straight road or winding turns up the mountains, i enjoyed every bit of it. The suspension is a bit noisy at times on bumpy roads but that can be easily shadowed by the overall drive quality. The drive is really smooth and comfortable and cabin is very quiet. The AC is also good. Even with 5,6 people on board, it doesn't loose acceleration. A great car built by Suzuki and the best in its class. Haven't driven the manual variant that much but the auto variant  with ladder type gear box is a treat to drive. Would recommend this to anyone looking for an AT car !!

The Suzuki Kizashi midsize sedan is a serious attempt to bring the company's automotive division up to snuff. Billed as a sophisticated sports sedan at a family-sedan price, the Kizashi generally delivers. It looks sharp, it drives well and its interior is one of the nicest in the segment. While the Kizashi is billed as midsize, its dimensions actually fall in between that segment and increasingly large compacts. This means it's in the unique position to compete against both camps. It's larger, more luxurious and better built than most compacts, yet less expensive and agiler than the midsizers. We think it's definitely worth a look, but the biggest obstacle could be finding one given Suzuki's limited dealer network.

The Suzuki Carry, however, was like a small giant as its high ground clearance and the tough body gave it a surprisingly strong character that helped it to tackle almost anything was thrown at it. For its tiny dimensions, the Carry boasted a pretty large load area with a load deck measuring 1,620mm long, 1,340mm wide and 1,100mm height. The vehicle had also received a few design elements which make it look pretty cute such as the huge headlights, a wrap-round bumper, the sculpted bonnet and the huge windshield. The side panels of the van versions were mostly flat and were fitted with a large opening sliding door, while at the back there is a vertically opening tailgate.

Having company fitted alloy rims , exceptional paint quality on bumpers ( as I had  old cultus and alto before , there bumper paint quality on bumpers and edges was little bit compromised)  and Much better grip. Interior is same as exterior. It is the blend of  quality and craftsmanship. Most of the people compare  Cultus with city and swift, Sorry to say that all are in state of serious insanity. If you compare price tag for on road 0 meter cultus swift and city, VXL costs you 14.5 million, city  currently 17.8 million and swift for  15.5 million ( for non-filer) . And  rest of  the people , claiming that  cultus is marketed globally with price tag of 9  million, then let me confirm, it is the basic variant and the top of line variant cost  13 lakhs just factory price and if you import that 0 meter car after custom , freight and insurance etc it would cost you around 23 lakhs , which people are talking about.

Since beginning I am using Shell V power and getting fuel economy of 11-12 KM/l with A/C in urban area. - Air Condition is also good. - Car handling and grip is excellent. - Interior is average.- Interior accessories quality is average- Exterior is good- Exterior accessories are good and robust- Engine parts seems to be mostly imported(of Nippon Denso ND) so are seems good.Recommended for those people which need powerful hatchback.

It was introduced in 2001 as a replacement for the Suzuki Esteem/Baleno, with a tall 5-door SX model hatchback (for maximum inner room efficiency) and a 4-door sedan body. It featured two different 16-valve gasoline straight-4 engines, with 1.5 L and 1.8 L, this one capable of 125 PS (92 kW; 123 hp) JIS. Production was discontinued in 2007 around the world and replaced by the Suzuki SX4, except in China where it is built by Changhe-Suzuki since 2005                    More                                    Less\\nStyle: 4\\nComfort: 5\\nFuel_Economy: 4\\nPerformance: 5\\nValue_for_Money: 3\\nYear: 2017', metadata={'source': 'suzuki review', 'row': 606}),\n",

The interior is beautiful. Yes there  are places where cheap plastic is used but thats the same case with any other car in this price bracket. The biggest thumbs up: Pak Suzuki is offering and making the same value and quality in this car as those made Celerios made in europe or other places.

So you be the judge of that.Interior is good and spacious but the sound system (keeping in mind the price) is not good & all around cheap plasticy feel is there. And it is not comparable to its japenese imported competation (vitz).Well dont know about the fuel economy exactly but the average that it had in its meter was 10 KM/L (last driven)My Final words about this car are it's price should be around 10 (1 Million) comparing to local standards. It is just a Wagon R with some extra nut and bolts and new face.

Interior is very good and classic looking. two tone color scheme is beautiful. Inner space is also very good. Transmission is superb, easily coast at120 kmph at 2.5K rpm. No body rattling so far.

I bought this car this year solely on the basis of reviews in Pakwheels forums.The car looks good from the front but overall its a bit of a turn off. However, the interior is really spacious and comfy. Pros: The dashboard and overall plastic quality is satisfactory for a car from Pak Suzuki. The drive is also smooth. The suspension is solid and not very noisy on bumpy roads. The steering is also very good, a little slippery but a nice steering cover can fix that. The sound system, immobilizer and nice spacious interior makes it a really good choice in cars of this  category. I would totally recommend this car to anyone looking for a car under 11 lacs, which is still high but worth it as you're getting a zero meter car.

Not recommended to anyone in general and tall people in particular. if you are 6 feet plus like me, then your head would surely touch the roof of the car and you need to incline the front seat to be comfortable. Air conditioner is just a button on the dash and regardless at what fan speed you run it, you are bound to sweat throughout the summers. The AC becomes better from November till February, when you really need a heater. There is no insulation of the car and it becomes an oven very soon. The stock rear view mirror and side mirrors are no good and you need to put in mirrors from other car models in order to see properly. There is no intervalometer in the wiper, and you have to manually engage the wiper every now and then. The fuel economy of this car is way over-rated. Whatever you gain in mileage is off-set by expenses on repair maintenance of wheels bearings, suspension and steering assembly.

Mileage is as good as after running period of car. 14+ km/l with 100% ac and 16 +km/l without ac all within city driving. Engine is smooth as silk, it has great pick up.Dashboard is soundless no noise, Plastic quality is good, Interior does not catch dust easily, chrome is still intact only gear lever chrome got off but that is acceptable as it is manual car. I hear little bit noise from 1 door only on rough roads, i will try to get this fixed from 3S. There is no noise in suspension or breaks whatever the road is. In short I am very satisfied with it. It is a great car for city driving condition.There are only 2 negative points, Paint quality is not good, very thin layer of paint. Fuel pump has some noise.

The first drive took me by surprise as i felt in total control of the vehicle. The stearing was light. The power was reasonable for an automatic. Excellent road grip. Nice interior. Suspension felt a bit stiff . The transmission is smooth. Then came the ugly part. I noticed periodic noise and some times grinding noise when i pressed hard on brakes. Took it to the dealer next day. They had to adjusted the brakes to eliminate the noise. This should not have happened to a new car. But anyway they provided excellent support and fixed the issue. I can also hear small rattles in left door panel. Other than that i am happy with the car's performance. Suzuki did a real good and surprising job.

But when you drive it as a hyper mil-lager (RMP 2000-2400), (Gear Shifting RPM 1700-2000)   it'll give  you 23-27KM/L..

The steering is also buttery smooth thanks to its electronic nature and the brakes seem responsive, even though they are not ABS.The exterior is okay. The front looks beautiful with the deer-eyed headlights. Fog lamps can be added to provide further beauty. However, the rear looks like a pathetic 'dabba' and it isn't streamlined at all. Fuel economy was good at 16-17 km/l in city traffic. The average dropped to 14-15 km/l with AC.One of the worst things I experienced with Wagon R is its instability at high speeds.; cross the 100 kph mark and the cabin begins to vibrate. Exceed 120 kph and the vibrations become unbearable to an extent that you have to slow down. I believe the cabin shake is a combination of faulty rims and the 'tall-boy' design.Wagon R's gearbox is a bit of a pain in the reverse gear but I think it will get better with time.

Although some people will prefer vitz, i think this car's curves are more pleasing to the eye, than the angular lines of the new vitz.Interior is simple but not bad. The controls are light and easy to access from the left hand while driving. The interior is almost all plastic, which is  normal for cars in this price bracket.The engine is sufficiently powerful, with DOHC, 1328 cc and 90 bhp, it can easily break free from the highway traffic, or speed off a stop light. Higher RPMs are easily managed by the M13A engine.  The engine lacks VVT so fuel consumption is not a highlight, but the power output is basically linear and predictable. I sometimes felt the engine fell short on torque wih 110 Nm. In my opinion a torque output of 150 Nm would make it more pleasing to drive, especially when loaded and climbing. 5 MT is very smooth and shifts pleasurably, had no issues with it.

This vehicle has followed the concept of quality rather than quantity. I would suggest people not to buy Vitz which at the end of the day is second hand screwed up, used vehicle.

Stylish and sporty look with graceful interior. It is the best deal one can get in this price. When you buy this car, you don't have to even think of adding any extra features, it is already fully loaded including ABS, power steering, fog lights, media player, nice seat covers, power mirrors, immobilizer,  key less entry etc.1328cc engine that too in a small car means lot of power. In acceleration, it can easily beat corolla and city. You feel like having an extremely responsive car in your hand. Fuel economy is reasonable. 12-13 km/L in city and around 15 on highway. About the defects people complain: One odd issue may arise and it is common with every car. But, it is still much better than buying a Japanese VItz which has come to Pakistan after being screwed for 2-3 years atleast. Actually running would be more than 70,000 Kms but people will buy it with a meter reversed at 9,000 kms..

After three months, there was noise and vibration coming from the back side. Again got it checked, the dealer said they will have to change the bearing...imagine bearing usually lasts a lifetime and this was changed within one year! This car is a waste of money with lots of problems, i suggest don't go for this car. The paint job is also not impressive.  Noises coming from interior even though i am a very careful driver.

In other words i & other owners lost 90,000 Rs out of our hard earned on the new year night.

I want to warn  every one out there that no body should buy new launched cars of Pak Suzuki caz they dont care for there customers of new cars.

I thought Suzuki will aim high and provide a car with latest trends however when i reached the show room i was disappointed as many features & accessories which are advertised as style-mark are removed even from VXL version and put on sale for around 95000 if purchased all in one go.It speaks that Suzuki is aimed at making money and doesn't care about customers. secondly there is no one regulating prices and standards every authority is fed well to close the eye.

This car was just awesome. Having airbags, anti-lock breaking system, fully loaded, power steering, power windows, retractable mirrors. The car has a beautiful basket inside the frond passenger seat. Beautiful mirror with light inside the sun light protector ( don't know the correct name this is what is in front of driver and front passenger to block sunlight)When Suzuki launched its model in Pakistan I was very excited and the very next day I visited Suzuki Showroom. I was just shocked to see what they are selling for Pakistanis. Do they think we are useless people? Our life costs nothing? In Pakistan assembled Wagon R there in NO Air Bag, Anti-Lock Breaking, Only front windows are powered, No retractable mirrors even the seats are uncomfortable.Still the price is almost 1 Lac high.I don't know why people are still purchasing this bull Shit. Suzuki has no right to play with the people of Pakistan                    More                                    Less\\nStyle: 3\\nComfort: 2\\nFuel_Economy: 3\\nPerformance: 2\\nValue_for_Money: 1\\nYear: 2014\", metadata={'source': 'suzuki review', 'row': 747}),\n",

The driving posture is unique in a good way after driving Civic when I set I feel like driving an SUV and its a good feeling but seats are flat I feel like without proper seat belts I would fall off of them.In short after we drive Civic, Corolla and Daewoo all nice saloons with nice road grip and interior when we drive this we dont feel bad or anything like you do when you drive Alto or Cultus and Mehran instead this gives you a nice feel.

However, if we talk about interior, it is really cool. But still the material which has been used is of low quality. AC works awesome, Seating is really comfortable. I had a drive for continuously 7 hours and felt no cramps in my legs or tiredness.I got 17.9 Kms/Ltr. with AC on Highway Drive. Within the City, it gave 13 Kms/Ltr.I'd a long drive with WagonR, I was worried due to its small-sized tyres, but it is really amazing, I went upto 150 speed and it went awesome. Brakes worked so good, pick is so nice.I was worried after reading the feedback, while I bought this car. After having personal long drive. I am so much comfortable with its performance. I was a user of Cultus and must say that if someone is looking for good exterior looks than must go for Cultus but if you want really a new change within the same pricing, than WagonR is 100 times a good change Suzuki have made.

No, the only choice we have is Cultus with noisy dashboard , total manual ,14 years old model , and handling is not better that Wagon R , you dont feel comfortable while driving it on 110/120 on highways .

To my disappointment the car's first looks were very ugly. Why would I even have a test drive or check it's comfort or fuel economy when it looks worse than Adam Revo. They have stripped off some necessary car beauty elements such as good front grill, air pressers, alloy rims, under-engine protective shields and the list goes on. They went too far with the practicality and now it looks more like a donkey cart than a car worth 11 Lakh. Gone are the days when people didn't have other options and they had to buy Mehran, Cultus or Alto. Now they are aware of the features, the cars have these days (Thanks to JDM cars). Wouldn't someone prefer a much better Passo, Vitz, Mira or any other JDM car over a local Wagon R for this much price? I wouldn't buy this car for more than 8 Lakhs.For JDM WagonR, view the link given below.http://www.pakwheels.com/used-cars/suzuki-wagon-r-2009-for-sale-in-sargodha-726958                    More                                    Less\\nStyle: 1\\nComfort: 3\\nFuel_Economy: 4\\nPerformance: 3\\nValue_for_Money: 1\\nYear: 2014\", metadata={'source': 'suzuki review', 'row': 779}),\n",

We were apprehensive to buy automatic version but now after a month of use and over 1000 KM milage we are glad that we bought the automatic version.The exterior is very elegant and has sporty look. We have the white color which I think looks pretty (personal view on color). The interior is fine although not luxurious. The car comes with immobiliser and has factory fitted Bridgestone tyres and Alloy Rims save you at least 40 to 50K when you buy City or Xli. The Alpine stereo system is nice and is adequate for daily use. The performance of Swift is excellent, great pickup, and stability even a high speeds. The breaks are super responsive and have ABS which Xli lacks. I'm getting 14kmpl easily with RPMs around 2000 to 2200.

And my favorite activity (like many of Pakwheelers) was to insult Mehran in every other post :) But when I entered professional life, I realized I can't spend my weekends in workshops just to get my vehicle running during weekdays. That was the time I needed some new vehicle.My maximum budget was 900 K and the only brand new car under this budget was Suzuki Mehran. Other options were to add some money and buy Cultus or go for imports (Mira, Alto or Passo). My considerations were running costs, ease of maintenance and resale.Analyzing these factor the optimum choice came out to be Suzuki Mehran. I currently own both the VX and VXR versions. Fully satisfied with the VX one but the VXR is horrible on fuel average even with AC off.Fuel Economy:VX giving 16-17 kmplVXR giving 13-14 kmpl without AC 10-11 kmpl with AC                    More                                    Less\\nStyle: 1\\nComfort: 1\\nFuel_Economy: 3\\nPerformance: 2\\nValue_for_Money: 3\\nYear: 2013\", metadata={'source': 'suzuki review', 'row': 818}),\n",

Head lights are excellent. Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Space is good, knees do not stuck while sitting in the back. AC performance is much better than previous versions. However, at 100 kph, and temperature above 35 degree, AC performance declines. Easily runs at 140 kph on motorway without any shake ups. Since there is no CNG, trunk has a lot of space which is an added point. Fuel Economy: At 75-80 kph on long route without AC, gives you 26-28 km per litre, excellent, with AC gives 20-22 kpl. In city with or without AC, it gives 16-18 kpl, I found no difference with AC. However, at 130-140 kph with AC, it only gives 12 kpl.Ride Quality & Handling: Drive is smooth and handling is also as per expectations from a mehran. No difference from previous versions.Final Words: In Rs. 658,000 it is a good car for middle class family and it is the cheapest local assembled car in Pakistan. VXR better than VX.

But over all, a good decent look.Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Excellent interior in it's category. Spacious, good quality plastics used and comfortable seats. Very beautiful silver built-in music system's dashboard.Fuel Economy: This is probably the ONLY con of this car. Fuel-wise it's not as efficient as a city or vitz. However, this also depends on the driving style.Ride Quality & Handling: Amazing road grip. Superb acceleration. Really feels like the seat slipping from under you. No car can catch up to it. Not sure about the new Aspire 1.5 - but all the 1.3 cars were never up to the challenge of speed posed by this little beast.Final Words: This is one of the best cars to be rolled out of the PS assembly factory yet. The build quality is as good as a Civic (if not better). I can say that because I also own a Civic 2013.I have driven this Swift very rashly as well, taking it to far fledged areas of Punjab - but it's smoothness in the drive was never compromised. My advice to people who are considering to buy a 1300CC car - go for a Swift - an excellent ride for urban to sub-urban dwellers. Even though I am myself a Honda fan, I would recommend this Swift over a City (unless you want to go an extra mile and get the Aspire 1.5 which is a total waste of money because a few more bucks will get you an Altis - a far better car than Aspire). City's suspension is the worst ever - Swift is a very good car and can fit in many different roles - a first car for a young professional, a first car for a young couple or a small family, a second car for a upper-middle class family, etc                    More                                    Less\\nStyle: 4\\nComfort: 5\\nFuel_Economy: 5\\nPerformance: 5\\nValue_for_Money: 3\\nYear: 2013\", metadata={'source': 'suzuki review', 'row': 826}),\n",

Within the first month of its use, I experienced a tuk sound in low speeds and quick pick up. It was very annoying for me so i reported the same to My dealer (Suzuki Taxila Motors) from where I initially bought the car. I was told that it's the axle's fault. They reported the matter to the company. An authorized person (Mr. Ibrar)of Pak Suzuki for this region checked my car and said that its because of a pin in the gear box and that needs to be changed. so they lowered the gear box and changed that pin. the sound went off but only for a week. it came back and is there ever since.... Finally I was told try to live with it 'coz even the Japanese can't do anything about that......It really frustrates me!!! So did anyone experience the same sound?? and found any cure for that??? plz respond!Apart from that the car is Ok as far as its style and comfort is concerned. Fuel consumption is not that gud. Would give around 11 kmpl in local with AC and 14-15 KMPL on the highway. without AC the local average goes to around 12-13 kmpl and on highways from 15-16 kmpl.

The looks of swift is damn hot from every angle. Motto of swift lived up to my expectations. \"Feel Young Drive Young\".The only bad thing about it is low quality doors. They must have used good quality doors.Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Its interior is also quite attractive with very nice 2din CD Player with 4 awesome speakers which have very good bass and sound quality.The things which i wanted more are media buttons on steering, it would be too good to have. And less sound in cabin, but it is SUZUKI so we must know about it when we make our mind to bought it. Front seats are little hard but its ok, Rear seats are very soft and it is quite comfortable at back to sit.Fuel Economy: Fuel economy is good, its definitely not what people said. Within city with little bit ac it is giving me average between 11-15km/ltr, depending about driving style. But recommend people to change gear in btw 2-3K rpm. Ride Quality & Handling: Swift has little hard suspension so the ride drives kind of sporty with excellent pickup and very good at cornering. But is quite rough on bad or bumpy roads due to hard suspension but it is not the cars fault, it thats the road are quite bad here.Final Words: If anyone wants a brand new hatchback in the range of 1.3M then i will definitely recommend Suzuki Swift.

Pak Suzuki however (compared to the international version) has removed ABS, indicator lamps from the side mirrors, Outside Temperature reading and Estimated Mileage reading from the Pakistani version of Swift.Fuel Economy: 12 KMPLRide Quality & Handling: Ride quality is horrible on bumpy/damaged roads. Pak Suzuki is not fully doing there job when it comes to finishing. They probably don't even do a drive test before the car is made ready for delivery. You can spot a thousand problems in their brand new car, mostly mechanical issues. The inside of the doors are bare metal without any padding of  sound absorbing materials etc. So they vibrate when you crank the volume up on your sound system. Also on bumps the ride gets too noisy. On smooth roads however the cabin is pretty quiet. Suspension is hard, but that gives you the advantage of good braking and good handling.Final Words: It is for sure a lovable car. You can really feel the thrust with which the car moves when you push the accelerator all the way down. One reviewer mentioned that the car doesn't move above 120KMPH but this is because he couldn't really push the accelerator further down. I'm not sure whether this is a feature or not but accelerator pushes very easily until a point. Beyond that point you need to press it quite harder and that is the point when the car actually goes above 120KMPH. Build quality sucks big time, but the engine doesn't. I'm really enjoying my ride.

Its the fully loaded version at that time, power steering, power windows and alloy rims. So far after three years every electrical and mechanical equipment is working fine. This car has the best leg room space in its class no doubt. I have also driven the Honda city, the rare and front leg room of Cultus is amazingly equal to HOnda City and the ride is even much more comfortable than Honda City. Its unfortunate the Suzuki has stopped the VXL version of cultus (only to promote the Swift) but I wish that they re-launch its fully loaded version with Electrical Power Steering (EPS). My VXLi has hydraulic Power Steering. Overall its one of the most comfortable, reliable and fule economical car in town given me almost 22 kmpl on highway and 17 kmpl in city with AC on CNG. On petrol it gives almost 17 kmpl on highway and 15 kmpl in city with AC. I am very much satisfied with this car and am using it for the past three years without any problem. I got it zero meter and so far it has crossed 66000 kms.

Next door in India same shit has been changed to modern look, quality is much better and available for 1/2 of the price compare to Pakistan.Every time government try to relax imports duty on cars.

Only Vitz has been the best cars in imported ones. you'll not get the resale value of imported cars after 3 years.

Over the passage of time Suzuki has hardly made any interior/exterior change. Car prices are constantly rising and its price started around 5 Lacs is not at 8,21,000 Rs which is not worth the product and you may opt for Imported Car in this range and even lower.The handling is a nightmare on its Stock tyres, and the car is also extremely stiff and bumpy. So changing to softer and wider tyres is recommended, which will make a lot of difference in its comfort and grip. The car will handle fine till 80kms; above that and you will feel like losing it. It comes with hydraulic steering system which is acceptable for the reason that EPS at high speeds due to high steering sensitivity will become a risk.Interior wise this car has sub standard build quality and squeaks from a new car are nothing new. Recently they changed the traditional cassette player to JVC CD/mp3 Player. The seats are a little uncomfortable specially while turning when the body roll takes over and you literally start moving to the sides. The A/C works just fine if not good.Exterior wise the looks still come from the 90's and nothing has been upgraded; it even does not have rear screen defrostThe positive point is its spare parts. They are as cheap as anything and you can get them from almost everywhere at some serious cheap price. So driving in traffic takes the edge off you.Economy on CNG is around 4Rs/Litre while on Petrol with A/C; local it would hardly give you 12km, on Long route it increases to 14km/l which is still not acceptable for 1000cc Carby engine.This cars engine has been discontinued worldwide and recently this model was taken off the chart from Suzuki Pakistan.

I had a tough situation to get through. Here in norway swift is a hit. I decided to go against advice of lots of people(which obviously was to buy toyota or honda) i decided to experiment and bough suzuki swift. I drove it and just kept on driving i fell in love with this spectacular machine as response and overall quality was awesome. No other car in pakistan comes with so much pre loaded gadgets. Keyless entry,Power mirrors,power steering,power windows,power cooling (AC is super cool)smooth gear shifting,bridge stone tyres,good sound system(no need for aftermarket expense on replacing sound system as it give you decent and enough bass to enjoy your journey) and last but not least ABS features makes it one hell of mean machine. Accelaration is the best part of this machine. Love its engine sound as it sounds compact and crispy whenever u press accelarator. Dint spend alot of money after purchasing just paid for poshish and mats and nothing else. Although little tight in diggy but one is not always on a road trip. Well compiled package by pak suzuki this time in a good price. Hats off to suzuki guys for giving us suzuki swift and breaking traditionaly duopoly of honda and toyota.

A customer who booked Suzuki Mehran said that Suzuki Dealers Jhelum  received Rs 21000 as registration charges and Rs 15000 as freight charges on delivery of vehicle. He said he requested the dealers to give him vehicle documents and he would get the vehicle registered with Mandi Bahauddin Excise Department but  the dealer refused to oblige him telling that it was Suzuki Company policy that dealers would get the vehicle registered.  He also refused to register vehicle with Mandy district and registered vehicle at Jhelum, a station of his own choice. Excise authorities when contacted told that registration for Suzuki Mehran was near about Rs 15000. Regarding freight charges no bill giving details was shown to him. The customer further told that attitude of dealers after booking a vehicle grows harsh and they dictate their own terms. About quality of Suzuki he said its several parts were not fitted properly. Rear and front bumpers were tilting downward. Leaf springs of rear suspension were not in proper alignment. Interior holstry, vinyl and lining of doors were not properly fixed. Wheels balancing and vehicle alignment were not satisfactory. AC which costs Rs 52000 gives poor cooling and runs heavy. On first inspection, faults observed were pointed out to mechanics who said that these faults were caused by poor and bad workmanship at the factory while assembling the vehicle. It may be mentioned that Suzuki Mehran is a vehicle that people with low income purchase. Under Yellow Cab Scheme this vehicle is sold on easy installments to selected persons at price one lakh cheaper as compared to those who purchase through booking. This disparity in price is unjustified.Sher Gondal                    More                                    Less\\nStyle: 5\\nComfort: 5\\nFuel_Economy: 5\\nPerformance: 5\\nValue_for_Money: 5\\nYear: 2012', metadata={'source': 'suzuki review', 'row': 922}),\n",

              " Document(page_content=': 925\\nModel: Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3\\nOverall_rating: 4\\nDate: 2012-05-03\\nReview: A month back i had an option to Buy a car for myself. It could have been anything Gli, City, Vitz, Belta. Basicly anything with a small engine. :D . So after much thought i went for the Suzuki Swift. I had never driven it before, and sat in it once when it was newly launched. When i picked it from the showroom i was expecting it to be a typical Suzuki. BUT was in for a surprise. The 1.3 Dohc is one mean machine. The power Delivery is BIG, it simply goes crazy . I agree its not like Gli in terms of fuel consumption but it covers that with the fun factor when u floor the pedal. :D . The ABS does what it is supposed to do, the breaks are responsive. The ride compared to the City is MUCH better, City is known for its hard seats. But the Swift is comfortable on long drives and on bumpy roads.         When one thinks about SUZUKI the word BAD QUALITY instantly comes to ones head. But in the Swift its diffrent . The build quality is impressive. Suzuki has left no loose ends, both from the inside and out. The Air Conditioning is as they say CHILLLING :D  The leg rooom happens to be excellent for a person of good build and height i.e 6Foot and 80kgs .        People may say that 12 Lakhs is TOO much for a Suzuki or rather a small car. But the thing is its not a small car, its a hatchback!!!! What car gives u Alloy Rims, Keyless Entry, Fog Lamps, Power Windows and Adjustable SideView Mirrors in 12 lakhs and that to Zero Meter. The tires supplied by suzuki are good Bridgestones, not the EURO STAR that come with Honda and Toyota. A good stereo Supplied by Alpine which complements the whole dashboard and completes its look. Impressive, no.?        You the reader might say im going on showering praises on the car cause i own it myself. No thats not the case , im telling from experience as i have owned or happend to drive its competitors and yes the Swift has its flaws. Its heavy on fuel. But it does give 11km/l and above with normal city driving. And i happend to notice it does have UnderSteer, maybe its the way i drive but it does tend to messup a bit in the corners. Another FLAW i noticed is that the car is low, when at full capacity driver has to be carefull on the speed breakers. The resale value on the other hand is considerd to be LOW when taking into account other cars.      Thats about everything i have to say about the car. In looks its small , Drives like a big car and goes like one aswel . I personaly do not promote rash driving but in times of need or emergncy the swift is perfectly capable of doing 170km/h on the Moterway . Tried and tested to 175km/h. I hope my article helps you in deciding on the car if your intrested :))                    More                                    Less\\nStyle: 4\\nComfort: 4\\nFuel_Economy: 5\\nPerformance: 4\\nValue_for_Money: 3\\nYear: 2012', metadata={'source': 'suzuki review', 'row': 925}),\n",

I had many concerns as I have been suzuki products for more than 15 years, But when I looked at exterior, interior & specially drive its not near suzuki. Its unbelieving  more than I expected from suzuki! The package price is bit more than cultus for which I had initially opted, but its sporty look, road grip as good as city, ABS, alloys imported tires,fogs,power pack, quality audio system & most of all its looks hatchback & smallish but its driving ease, grip & performance all matching any perfect new sedan.Well I can not predict about fuel economy as I have not driven it much. The other negative is lack of proper trunk , but its still useful for little bit luggage. The other comparision is Vitz, but its definitely used one with expensive parts. I will say this car is the best issue of Suzuki Pakistan so far, I can suggest if trunk is not considered of supreme priority, swift DLX is much better choice than XLI/GLI/city         Now it has been driven about 3300km, the fuel economy is average. 3s says it will improve after 5000km. It is giving me about 11 -12 in city & it consumed 1.25 tanks from Abbottabad to Lahore(about1000km) & back with A/C , on Motorway & speed of 120km/h with occasional 140 for overtaking, so its fine.It has great power & it easily touched 170plus on motorway.

People who have driven larger cars than cultus find it rubbish. The interior is not of good quality. The engine makes very much sounds. The car applies too much force on the engine when going uphill and cultus has larger body as compared to alto and they both have the same engine of 1000cc. So i think that altois cheaper and better than cultus. Instead of buying a new cultus worth 925,000 you can buy 2004-5 model corolla or honda city.

Yes disappointed at manufacturers like Toyota, Honda and the likes. The Swift turns out to be a direct and ruthlessly angry stare in the eyes of the other 1.3 liter counterparts.Positives of swift are certainly a lot more than the Negatives. For Instance the Alloy wheels, Imported Tires, Power/window-mirror-steering, and the worthiest mention ABS add great value to the overall package that one pays for. A relatively decent sound system with only one downside (The speakers buzz at high bass levels, obviously on high volumes). The car overall pays-off fairly well given the amount spent.Before i forget to assert on the ridiculous mileage, let me just add that the kind of power swift delivers would certainly bear a price tag that comes in the form of high fuel consumption. But then again the power delivered through the 1.3 liter mechanical piece of art justifies that to a great extent. I have managed to attain a 10km/l mark within the city, which is decent. Fill the tank and a one-side sprint on motorway can be done in a little more than half a tank equating it to around 18km/l.I have had a chance to manage a pocketful of road tickets on motorway for speeding, but my toe just wouldn’t ease without flooring the gas pedal. Crank it, kill it and knock the 175 km/h barrier fairly easily. And by the way I love doing that. I heardGreat work Suzuki. Simply love it.

Since it was the first Suzuki in the family, I was a little skeptical on how things would turn out. The first 500kms have been alhamdulillah satisfying. The fuel average that I got (that's after the 1st refilling of the tank) is 12.98 km/l. I've seen people saying it doesn't give more than 9-10 initially but 12.98 is what I got. This includes extra urban (traffic jams) as well as straight roads mostly with no a/c since it’s winter. The new integrated in-dash is a nice touch. The volume knob is so easy to operate just like the one in the Vti-Oriel. Since mine is to be used as a second car (self use only with primary commuting to office and home), I was initially planning for the DX version but the additional 100 grand it worth the dough. Keyless entry is a must and so is ABS and Alloys ad a little glamour to the overall silhouette of the body.If budget is not a problem, the DLX is the one to go for. Nonetheless, Suzuki should be commended to provide basic amenities like PW and Central locking in the base version. Not to mention imported tyres too.Things I don’t likeThere is no assist grip for the driver and there are no jacket hangers at the rear assist grips. The steering despite being electrically assisted feels a like heavier than my steermatic’s. And it isn’t as precise either. Legroom at the rear is virtually non-existent and people with families should look at other options too.Overall a nice package and good value for money.

I am sure In few days arrangements  will be made for buying new Cultus with factory fitted CNG.I live in USA and will be using this car few weeks a year on my visit to Pak. I know in 2009 Suzuki offered power stearing, alloy wheels, fog lights and power windows previously.To my disappointment these accessories are not being offered now. I want a car with dual fuel factory fitted CNG, not after market install.As far as I know, right now Toyota and Suzuki  are they only ones. Offers petrol and CNG in few models. Choices is very limited in Pak for dual fuel. I like Toyota crolla with factory fitted CNG, but driving few weeks in a year doesn\\'t justify to spend close 18 grands. So I decided to go far Cultus 2011.Though it\\'s 2012 but still in Pak market 2012 Cultus is not available yet. I don\\'t understand why is that. Here in USA 2012 models were available in Sept. every year.I visited Pak Suzuki web site and was very disappoined. Very minimal informations were available about their freking products.

Its driving is so smooth like a luxurious car. The interior is perfect, sides are covered with plastic material. Brakes work fine below speed of 80. Engine is powerful. Car can be easily turned in a small space. A/C is great. It gives good mileage on CNG as compared to Petrol. I think this car has no comparision with coure or mehran. You can say Coure is an improved version of Mehran.Howevere there are some negative things as well. The engine of alto is a bit noisy. Road grip in not soo good with the tyres fitted by suzuki.

(in fact i learned driving using this vehicle! ) Firstly lets get to the basics, the Price. Currently its a bit overpriced. Though i would still go for it as a family 7-seater over any jeep/vehicle in this price range. Comfort: To be honest for an imported vehicle its not the most comfortable car. Though i have seen worse, much better than many Pakistani cars/vans. (and it has LOTS of SPACE! ) that's all that matters, i guess.. Consumption: On CNG its fairly cheap. Specially on long drives. On petrol its a bit expensive cause of the extra power due to the weight. But i'd prefer driving it on petrol all the time as its totally at a different comfort level on petrol! (though i don't pay for either, so i guess my opinion doesn't matter. My dad pays and he says its good on CNG :P ) Now to the other things that matter, Power: it has lots of power! the 1.5L engine is just about the right size for this vehicle. Safety: Here is where the APV looses most of its points. It has NO ABS! That really is the worst part. NO AIRBAGS! The tires, play an important role in keeping the car stable. if you change them to bigger ones, you might increase the comfort but decrease the stability! its fairly stable, as a teenager like me hasn't killed himself yet, using the vehicle. So its stable till that extent. Though after a few years it will be very risky to drive it over 120 km/h on the Motorway or anywhere for that matter, as it wobbles, and feels very unsafe. Practicality: It is the best car in this section. It has LOTS of space for ANY type of luggage.. Though the CNG cylinder does take a bit of space in the back, there is still room to put two big bags behind the rear seats. You can easily fit 10 people in it. Though the people at the back will be a bit squeezed. Add one of those roofs to it and your luggage problem for these ten people is solved. (if each person has a bag ) Overall, it is one of the best Cars/Vans i've seen in Pakistan. And in this price range any other vehicle of it's type can not compete with it. Though if you can manage the cost of fuel, i'd suggest getting a Prado or Pajero.. As they are more fun to drive and has way more power plus comfort. Only problem would be they'd be old and the APV would be brand new.

So according to your equation what mehran would be a better car then cuore wouldn't it be? You don't compare cars from their selling ratio. You compare them from their performance, value for money and services given in them. Now why toyota has more sales. Look first of all I don't think that anybody rational would say that Liana is better than corrolla that's a fact whether anybody admits it or not. And selling of more units is because of having the great reselling price and most of all the durability this car is offering, no other car even honda is giving it to its users. Great shocks with good life of engine even in rural areas. That's why its competing. If you look for value of money, meaning the price you are paying for the services you are getting, Sir you have to admit that Liana will get more rating. 1.2 M and it gives you everything that 1.4 M Xli doesn't give and 1.55 M Gli do gives you with an additinal abs, Thats it.

Suzuki should think about brakes even their abs system ain't very good, i don't have it but I do have reviews of many who have liana with abs. I was reading a review that missing problem on low gears in cng is pretty much high and he did alot to get out of it but nothing worked.

This engine was made by suzuki Japan in 1985 for Suzuki Jeeps and was used by paksuzuki for potohar jeep (The only discontinued model of Paksuzuki otherwise they never discontinue any vehicle like Mehran).This engine is fitted with a 5 speed gear box which is designed in such a way that its lower gear ratios are very close to each other because it was intended to be used in Jeep. However, when paksuzuki discontinued Potohar jeep they started to fit this engine in Alto. The body shape of this car is also running in some countries like Saudi Arabia etc., but not with this engine. Also this car in those countries has  not permission to come on motorways.It is due to this reason that some people observe and say that alto engine in very powerful and it climbs mountains with ease. It is true that it climbs mountains easily, even easier than cultus, but its power is same as that of cultus. it is just because of gear ratios. i would not mind if Napak Suzuki Motor Company fits jeep engine in  car, but at least they should have evaluated some dynamics. Since this engine is not for car. Due to misfit engine this car has it center of gravity near its center (which should be near front wheels) so turning this car at high speed results in swing around center and loss of control or turn over of car upside down. Therefore this car is higly unstable on road at speeds above 90 km/hr. In this respect it is even worse than Mehran.you can say it FALTO.handling and drive of this car is good, but keep in mind it is not safe at high speeds. Brakes of this car are good. But if you replace its stock tires otherwise paksuzuki install 145mm tread tires which have no surface area to grip the road. AC is good when the car is running at high speedsEngine does not become very hot or hard with AC, but cooling of AC is a problem. only front two passengers can travel in city with AC. It has no RPM meter. It fuel economy at CNG is good and at petrol approximately 12-16 km/l. Door trim of this car are very good made up of entire moulding with plastic which even suzuki is not offering in cultus.Ac knobs are rotary type which look good like sedan cars.Seats are not comfortable but not roasting like seats of Mehran.Inside space is insufficient especially for rear passengers. Body is good looking and compared to all other small cars of paksuzuki it is good value for money.

I drove it 26000 kms so far, was just only changing oil and filter. I am not saying teh car is immaculate but one has to see the over all raise in price for all the cars in Pakistan. Santro is not cheaper, neither the Cuore so over all you actually do not get the value for money but what options you are left with? its the cheapest amongst others with AC in it which is quote comfortable.I changed tires and installed Dunlop ECO, installed security system and seat covers, floor mats etc. Its reliable and never had any problem ALHAMDOLILLAH in long run. I took it to 150 Kms my self and though the engine was noisy but the drive was not like dangerous. Yes the breaking system is not that good, its average. Car do not have heating problem, until unless you fill the water bottle up to the mark full. Fuel consumption is not good but in CNG it goes to 250 kms in one full cylinder without ac, with ac its 150kms in local and 200 kms in long run. Gear conversion was tight but Suzuki dealer changes the gear oil at first 1000 kms free tuning, its better now. Engine is noisy because it has Potohar jeep's engine, but its more powerful on when you are driving it on mountains. Suzuki's over all quality assurance is worst so we can not say any of their model specifically is bad, what we get in cultus liana ? same door opening and closing issues - just an example. Car suspension is good enough and does not cause any noise if you drive it calmly in off road. We are left with no option if we have to buy a reliable family car which do not cause problem in long run, we have to buy mehran or alto, those who suggest to but second hand corolla or honda, do keep in mind that still they are second hand car and you can not rely on them when you are on motorway and surely do not like to face any technical issue with the car.For people who are planning to buy zero meter, I would suggest you either put some more money and buy some more luxurious car like Honda/  Corolla or buy this Alto VXR cng and do the following things.1. It will take long self because be default the tepats are tights, do not ask any mechanic to fix it, wait till 1st 1000 kms, than go for the dealer from where you have bought this car and they will adjust the tapets, starting will get superb undoubtedly.2. Do the cng setting and convert to cng after driving 1000 kms first on petrol.3. Ask the service manager to change or check gear oil so gear conversion gets soft.4. Change tires, general tires sucks and also harms the suspension as they are very hard. Go for Japenese Dunlop (suggested)5. Do the balancing and wheel alignment.6. Do not over fill the water bottle, my car only reduces 2% water from the bottle, DO NOT OVER FILL THE BOTTLE, keep it up to the mark - FULL.7. Change oil and filter every 4,000 kms either Zic or Caltex havoline, or shell.8. While washing, put plastic on the distributor to avoid any starting problem.9. Avoid taking it to the mechanic for pick or cng consumption, let the car settle down for 10,000 KMs, sometimes its cng quality which causes car do have the require pick up. (I did two tunings till 26,000 KMs.)10. If you need any more information, contact me on my email - [email\\xa0protected]Thanks!
